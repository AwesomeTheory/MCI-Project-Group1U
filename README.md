# MCI-Project-Group1U
This is a group project for the Master of Computing and Innovation students of the University of Adelaide.
The project description is as follows:

Project 1 Build your own university ranking system
Client: Tat-Jun Chin ( tat-jun.chin@adelaide.edu.au )

Owing to their popularity amongst students and university leaders alike, academic league tables such as THES and ARWU often have significant influence on the operation and long term planning of universities and research institutes. Some of the popular university rankings, such as CSRankings and AIRankings, are purely publication data-driven systems that harvest publicly available bibliographies to compute numerical ranking scores. Given the outsized impact of such data-driven rankings on universities, it is worthwhile to study such systems in more detail.
In this MCI project, you will be tasked with building your own data-driven university ranking system. The main tasks are:
- Find out how the software of existing ranking systems work.
- Write programs that can automatically scrape bibliographical databases for publication data.
- Design and build repository systems that can store the progressively harvested data in a scalable way.
- Devise and compare ranking scores computed based on the harvested data.
- Design and develop web-based visualisation systems for the constructed ranking system.


According to our client's requirement, we have forked the exisitng CSRankings, and are trying to make improvements to it.
